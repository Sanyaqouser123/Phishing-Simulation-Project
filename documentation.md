# Phishing Campaign Simulation Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
This project simulates a phishing attack using **GoPhish** to send targeted phishing emails that mimic a **Google Account Verification** alert. The phishing campaign focuses on deceiving users into providing their login credentials by simulating a suspicious login attempt on their Google account.

## 2. Objective
The objective of this phishing campaign is to:
- Test the effectiveness of phishing techniques in tricking users.
- Understand how attackers exploit social engineering.
- Simulate a realistic scenario in a controlled environment to raise awareness of phishing threats.

## 3. Tools & Technologies
The following tools were used in this project:
1. **GoPhish**: Phishing framework for managing campaigns.
2. **Kali Linux**: The operating system for setting up the phishing environment.
3. **ngrok**: To make the local phishing server publicly accessible.
4. **HTML/CSS**: Used to create the email template and landing page.

## 4. Phishing Campaign Details

### 4.1 Email Template Code
The email template was designed to resemble a Google account verification message. You can view the complete email template code in the [email_template.html](./email_template.html) file.

### 4.2 Landing Page Code
This landing page mimics a Google login page where users are prompted to enter their credentials. You can view the complete landing page code in the [landing_page.html](./landing_page.html) file.

## 6. Screenshots
Screenshots of the email and landing page can be viewed in the [images](images) directory.

## 7. Conclusion
The phishing simulation demonstrated how social engineering tactics can be used to deceive users into disclosing their credentials. This exercise helps in understanding the potential risks and improving defenses against such attacks.
